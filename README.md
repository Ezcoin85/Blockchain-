# Blockchain-
The Blockchains and how they work


So if you've gotten this far then it's safe to assume you've probably heard the word BLOCKCHAIN at least once. Cryptographic Hash Function. Algorithms. etc. its important to note some Fundamental principals.


- Does the Cryptography have a Blockchain? 


- Can you verify proof of work?


- Is there a digital ledger.


if your search into the many variations of blockchain (over 500) you are able to determine these 3 factors then you are on the right path... 


SCAMS ARE ON THE RISE: in the last couple of years thus dubbing the term #SCAMCOIN all across the internet. people being deceived into buying into "its going to be bigger than bitcoin!" or "its a bitcoin killer!" investors are tricked into giving phony programmers and developers large sums of money for a product that doesn't even exist...


please educate yourselves in the understanding of blockchain environments and security. 


most countries don't yet regulate cryptography so if your coins are taken (especially Bitcoins) Then they're gone! becareful where you store them is critical! Do not necessarily trust large exchanges like U.S. San Francisco based COINBASE. remember NO REGULATION = NO GUARANTEE FOR SAFETY
